# CS4450-Parser-Final-Project

## Group Members

## Description

Our project includes a basic Python parser using ANTLR and Java. The use of ANTLR allows us to implement CFGs to cover basic syntax requirements, including support for things such as arithmetic operators, if/else blocks, conditional statements, while and for loops, comments, and function calls, along with a few other features. These features were implemented in the g.g4 file located in the src directory. When you test the program, you will see the space to input test code and next to it you will see the parse tree.

## Setup

For the setup, you need the IntelliJ IDE, with a jdk8 package. Once you have both of these, you can open and run IntelliJ and head over to the marketplace where you will then install the latest version of ANTLR's plugin.
